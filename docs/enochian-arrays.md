# Enochian Chess Starting Arrays

This document details the eight possible starting arrays for Enochian Chess, as described by Chris Zalewski in "Zalewski-Enochian-Chess-of-the-Golden-Dawn.txt". Each array is referred to as a "setting" and dictates the initial placement of pieces for each of the four armies.

## General Setup Information

*   The King has no single pawn; all the pieces and pawns of its angle are its vice-regents.
*   At the beginning of game play, a pawn is placed only in front of the piece it serves.
*   The "squares" (1-4) below refer to the primary squares within each angle where the major pieces are placed. Pawns are then placed directly in front of their corresponding major pieces.
